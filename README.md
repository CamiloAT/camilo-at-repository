A cinematic immersive personal portfolio for Camilo Andrés Arias Tenjo (Camilo AT), a Systems Engineer from UPTC. Built with a dark brown/amber color scheme, scroll-driven animations, and a film strip aesthetic — designed to stand out from generic developer portfolios.

## Main Features

- **Cinematic Preloader** — Animated countdown with SVG VHS noise and film strip borders that fade in after loading
- **Scroll-Driven Animations** — Every section uses Framer Motion scroll-triggered reveals, parallax effects, and clip-path transitions
- **Floating Music Player** — YouTube IFrame API integration with a 10-song playlist, play/pause/prev/next controls, equalizer animation, and a playlist modal
- **Interactive Project Modals** — Detailed project views with image carousels, CLI terminal outputs, collaborator links, and tech stack tags
- **Dock Navigation** — Fixed navigation with section-aware scroll offsets for both desktop and mobile viewports
- **Fully Responsive** — Adaptive layouts for mobile with stacked cards, top navigation bar, and optimized typography
